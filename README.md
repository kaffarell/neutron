This is a light and simple code Editor called neutron which I made with
C# and Windows Form in Visual Studio 2017

Download the whole repository and execute once:
```
/neutron/bin/debug/neutron.exe
```
after that you will find a shortcut on the Desktop.

Current version: v1.4.0
Codename: "cosmic warrior"
